the Empire of Nicaea and in favour of the rival Despotate of Epirus. Arbanon had long been an autonomous principality within Epirus, and the Nicaean conquest around 1255 was resented. The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor Constantine Chabaron. The rebels were active in Durr\u00eb, Ohrid, Debar and Mat. The Nicaean forces were under the command of George Akropolites, who described the events himself in his history. In the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left Thessaloniki and by way of Kastoria entered Kounavia, Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, Michael II, and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in Kanina. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to Prilep and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos. The most decisive battle was fought in the city of Devol. After suffering heavy losses, the Byzantines were finally able to control the situation, but in the years 1260-1270 the Albanian rulers revolted again in the region of Durr\u00ebs.", "qas": [{"id":

through the seemingly dismal Jets team in their first primetime appearance of the season.  Even though the Texans never trailed in the game, the Jets kept pace throughout, thanks in large part to a 100-yard kickoff return touchdown by the Jets' Joe McKnight.  The Texans were able to keep the Jets at bay just enough to earn a hard fought win on the road, and improve to 5-0, remaining one of only two teams undefeated in the NFL to this point along with the Atlanta Falcons.  This was also the first time the Texans have ever defeated the New York Jets in their 11-year history, making them 1-5 against the Jets overall and improving their regular season record to 5-0. On the opening drive Houston scored to take a 7-0 lead. Houston got the ball but was intercepted at their own 35. Mark Sanchez threw a touchdown to Josh Cumberland to make it 7-7. In the second, Arian Foster scored to make it 14-7. A Shayne Graham field goal made it 17-7 at the half. Houston would kick another field goal to make it 20-7. The ensuing kickoff was returned by Joe McKnight 100 yards to make it 20-14. Another Houston field goal made it 23-14. The Jets would get a field goal before the game ended to end it 23-17 Houston.

In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead with RB Marion Barber getting a 5-yard TD run. The Panthers got on the board with Matt Moore completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith. The Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Carolina began rallying with John Kasay getting a 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Dallas responded with Folk kicking a 23-yard field goal. The Panthers tried to come back as Kasay nailed a 25-yard field goal, but the Cowboys' defense held on for the win.

season at home against the Ravens.

They would increase their lead in the second quarter when Joe Flacco found Jeremy Maclin on a 48-yard pass to make it 10-0.  This would be followed up by a 2-yard touchdown run by Terrence West to make the score 17-0 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Ravens would go back to work with Tucker kicking yet another 25-yard field goal to make the score 20-0.  A scoreless fourth quarter made this the eventual final score of the game. With the loss, the Bengals started their season 0-1.  This is the team's first shut-out loss at home since 2001.

The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining. On third and fourth down, Flacco's passes fell incomplete to Mason and Clayton, ending the Ravens' hopes of a comeback. Brady then kneeled to hand the Ravens their first loss of the season and better the Patriots' record to 3-1.", "qas": [{"id": "7546a866-5682-4447-b922-13de2f61361c", "question": "Which team scored

DeMarco Murray also struggled in the first half, as he had a 12-yard loss on one run. In the second half, the Eagles opened up with an interception on Matt Ryan by Walter Thurmond and scored on their next 3 possessions, and took the lead late in the 4th quarter. However, Matt Bryant kicked a field goal to give the Falcons back a 26-24 lead and the Eagles had a chance to come back. However, the Eagles were stopped on 3rd & 1, and Cody Parkey missed a 44-yard field goal attempt. Malcolm Jenkins then made a critical stop on 3rd down to force a Falcons punt. The Eagles' next drive ended as Sam Bradford threw a pass to Jordan Matthews, but the ball bounced off him and was intercepted by the Falcons, sealing a Falcons' victory. Reigning NFL rushing champ DeMarco Murray had 8 carries for 9 yards, which included an 8-yard touchdown run.

This game would be against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had gone 8-8 last season and were 1-1 to start the season in 2011. The Jaguars would bench Luke McCown and start rookie Blaine Gabbert after McCown's disastrous 4 interceptions in a devastating 32-3 loss to the New York Jets. The Panthers would start the game by sacking Gabbert and getting a safety, to lead 2-0. With the score 5-3, one of the more memorable moments during the season occurred. A heavy rain started coming down, blanketing the stadium and flooding the concrete decks. Players slipped and slid all over the place, water going everywhere. Most dramatically, the excess water on the stadium's upper deck poured onto the lower deck which poured onto the field. Although the field had a drainage system, it was not designed for such an amount of water at once. Moments later, a Gabbert pass was picked off by Carolina's Sherrod Martin. However, for those watching the game on TV it was difficult to tell who picked the pass off or where he was. The reason was CBS' main camera feed was covered with so many raindrops that identifying specific players on the field was nearly impossible. Viewers, therefore, had to rely on the call from play-by-play announcer Spero Dedes as to exactly what was happening on the play. Subsequent replays gave them a clearer picture. With 0:06 left in the 1st half, Blaine Gabbert threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Mike Thomas which was both the first career touchdown pass by Blaine Gabbert and the first touchdown pass for the Jaguars in the 2011 season. Jacksonville would go up 10-5 at halftime, however, Carolina would come back. With 6:05 left in the 4th quarter, and the rain not coming down anymore although the field, players, and fans were still soaked, Cam Newton finally found Steve Smith for a gain of 13 yards. On the same drive, with 4:27 left, on a 3rd and 2, Cam Newton found his new tight end, Greg Olsen, for a 16-yard touchdown pass to put the Panthers up 14-10. They would get the 2-point conversion which would put them up 16-10. Then, at the Panthers 35-yard line, 0:06 remaining on the game clock, the last play of the game, Blaine Gabbert's pass was tipped and incomplete, not only was it the Panthers' first win of the season, it was also the first time since 2008 the Panthers defeated an AFC team as well as the first time tell won a game in September, this then put them at 1-2.", "qas": [{"id": "a8069fb3-b537-4a15-a18b-70b2453d5dd0", "question": "How many points did the New York jets win by during their game with The Jaguars?", "answer_type": "number", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["3", "8", "8", "1", "1", "2011", "4", "32", "3", "2", "0", "5", "3", "1", "36", "2011", "10", "5", "13", "2", "16", "14", "10", "2", "16", "10", "35", "2008", "1", "2", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "97bbc24f-8f80-4bad-9769-2d33fc2f4444", "question": "Which team got their first win of the season against a AFC team since 2008?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Panthers", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["3", "8", "8", "1", "1", "2011", "4", "32", "3", "2", "0", "5", "3", "1", "36", "2011", "10", "5", "13", "2", "16", "14", "10", "2", "16", "10", "35", "2008", "1", "2", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "8ab82200-28c8-4ec7-a2f4-10630896f36a", "question": "Who intercepted a Blaine Gabbert pass?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 968, "text": "Sherrod Martin", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["3", "8", "8", "1", "1", "2011", "4", "32", "3", "2", "0", "5", "3", "1", "36", "2011", "10", "5", "13", "2", "16", "14", "10", "2", "16", "10", "35", "2008", "1", "2", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "2081a599-ed68-4d75-812f-58cd1d077b4d", "question": "Who did Cam Newton throw a touchdown pass to?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 1991, "text": "Greg Olsen", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["3", "8", "8", "1", "1", "2011", "4", "32", "3", "2", "0", "5", "3", "1", "36", "2011", "10", "5", "13", "2", "16", "14", "10", "2", "16", "10", "35", "2008", "1", "2", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "af951abd-acb9-469d-a62c-d1fb09c04aff", "question": "Who threw a touchdown pass under 20 yards?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 1843, "text": "Cam Newton", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["3", "8", "8", "1", "1", "2011", "4", "32", "3", "2", "0", "5", "3", "1", "36", "2011", "10", "5", "13", "2", "16", "14", "10", "2", "16", "10", "35", "2008", "1", "2", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}]}]}, {"title": "nfl_68", "paragraphs": [{"context": "With two straight home wins under their belt, the Panthers flew to FedExField for an intraconference fight with the Washington Redskins.

With the advent of the steamship, it became possible to create massive gun platforms and to provide them with heavy armor protection. The Dreadnought battleships and their successors were the first capital ships that combined technology and firepower with a mobile platform. However, in the first half of the 20th century, the utility of air power in support of the fleet began to emerge. World War I pitted the old Royal Navy against the new Kaiserliche Marine  of Imperial Germany, culminating in the 1916 Battle of Jutland. The future was heralded when the seaplane carrier HMS Engadine and her Short 184 seaplanes joined the battle. In the Black Sea, Russian seaplanes flying from a fleet of converted carriers interdicted Turkish maritime supply routes, Allied air patrols began to counter German U-Boat activity in Britain's coastal waters, and a British Short 184 carried out the first successful torpedo attack on a ship. In 1918 the Royal Navy converted an Italian liner to create the first aircraft carrier, HMS\u00a0Argus, and shortly after the war the first purpose-built carrier, HMS Hermes was launched. Many nations agreed to the Washington Naval Treaty and scrapped many of their battleships and cruisers while still in the shipyards, but the growing tensions of the 1930s restarted the building programs, with even larger ships.

west to take on the San Diego Chargers at Quallcomm Stadium. During the week, Chris Henry had died, and to honor him, the team all wore the number 15 on their helmets. Chad Ochocinco paid tribute to his teammate by kneeling for a prayer after he scored a touchdown in the first quarter. The Chargers were the first to score, when Antonio Gates caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers. The Bengals answered back with a 26-yard field goal by Shayne Graham to make the score 7-3. In the second quarter, Chad Ochocinco caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer, and the Bengals took the lead, 10-7. Following the Bengals' touchdown, the Chargers also got a touchdown, to put the Chargers back on top, 14-10. Near the end of the first half, Shayne Graham kicked another field goal, this time from 25 yards, to make the score 14-13 at halftime. The Bengals could not manage to score in the 3rd quarter, while the Chargers got a touchdown and a field goal. The score was 24-13 at the end of the 3rd quarter. The Bengals finally managed to score in the 4th quarter when Laveranues Coles caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer. The Bengals went for a two-point conversion, and were successful, making the score 24-21. Later in the quarter, Shayne Graham kicked another field goal, tying the game at 24 points for each team. The Chargers were then able to reach field goal range, and Nate Kaeding kicked a long 52-yard field goal to win the game.

nostalgic&#8212;defeating the same Week 16 opponent they faced last year would make their path to the postseason slightly easier. The Panthers, starting Matt Moore at quarterback in place of the injured Jake Delhomme, quickly took control of the game, scoring on their first four possessions (a 38-yard John Kasay field goal; a 29-yard Jonathan Stewart touchdown run; a 22-yard Muhsin Muhammad touchdown catch; and a 2-yard catch for tight end Jeff King). Meanwhile, the Giants turned the ball over 3 times in the first half, and were shut out at halftime for the second time this season. In the third quarter, Carolina picked up where they left off, as Moore connected with Carolina's Steve Smith for a 27-yard score. The Giants finally got on the board on the ensuing drive, courtesy of a 40-yard Tynes field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Giants' Smith caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Manning, but a subsequent 2-point try failed. Carolina fullback Brad Hoover's 1-yard scoring run later in the fourth sealed the game for the Panthers. The Giants left Giants Stadium the same way they had opened it 33 years earlier; with a demoralizing loss. The loss, along with wins by the Cowboys and Packers this week, mathematically eliminated the Giants from the postseason, breaking their streak of 4 consecutive playoff appearances. Curiously, the last NFL game at Giants Stadium would not be a Giants game, but a Jets game; the Jets would play the Cincinnati Bengals at home on Sunday night in Week 17.", "qas": [{"id":

The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%. Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 Six-Day War, achieving 60 kills and 10 losses. However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In this extensive conflict Israel scored 171 of out of 261 total kills with heat-seeking missiles (65.5%), 5 kills with radar guided missiles (1.9%), and 85 kills with guns (32.6%). The AIM-9L Sidewinder scored 19 kills out of 26 fired missiles (73%) in the 1982 Falklands War.

Charles also employed mercenaries under the command of Maarten van Rossum in their support. However, when the tides turned against the rebels after 1520, Charles withdrew his support. Losing their financial support, the rebels could then no longer afford to pay their mercenary army. About the same time, the Arumer Zwarte Hoop also lost their leader.

Patriots traveled to Candlestick Park to face the 49ers in the first of two straight West Coast games for the Patriots. After a 49ers punt on their first series started the game, Cassel's second pass of the game was intercepted by linebacker Takeo Spikes to give the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 45-yard line. On the next play, 49ers quarterback J. T. O'Sullivan threw an interception of his own, this one to Meriweather at the Patriots' 4-yard line. A three-and-out for the Patriots on their ensuing drive ended in a 35-yard Chris Hanson punt that gave the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 30-yard line to begin their next drive. A defensive holding penalty on Patriots cornerback Deltha O'Neal on third down extended the drive, leading to a 16-yard touchdown catch by running back Frank Gore that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead. On the Patriots' next drive, a fumbled snap by Cassel set up 3rd and 8 from the Patriots' own 34-yard line; Cassel then threw a deep pass to Moss, which was caught at the 49ers' 21-yard line and run in for a 66-yard touchdown that tied the game at 7-7. A 38-yard Isaac Bruce reception from O'Sullivan on the 49ers' ensuing possession backed the Patriots' defense up to their own 22-yard line, and two plays later, O'Sullivan and Bruce again connected on a pass, this one a touchdown from 6 yards out to give the 49ers a 14-7 lead. An exchange of punts brought the teams into the second quarter, where on the third play of a Patriots drive Cassel threw his second interception of the day, this one to Nate Clements on the 49ers' 6-yard line on a deep pass intended to Moss. The 49ers went three-and-out, leading to a 13-play, 40-yard Patriots drive where a third down sack of Cassel in the red zone set up a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal that trimmed the 49ers' lead to 14-10. The 49ers punted again on their next possession, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 20-yard line with just over three minutes remaining in the first half. 11 plays later, the Patriots faced a 2nd and goal from the 49ers' 2-yard line, where a Faulk touchdown run gave the Patriots a 17-14 lead at halftime. On the Patriots' opening possession of the second half, Cassel was sacked to begin the drive, and then again was sacked nine plays later on third down to force the Patriots to punt. Two plays later, O'Sullivan was intercepted by safety Rodney Harrison to give the Patriots the ball at the 49ers' 24-yard line. The Patriots reached the 49ers' 1-yard line, but were denied the end zone twice by the 49ers, setting up fourth down from the 2-yard line. Faulk took the direct snap on the play and ran in for his second touchdown of the game, giving the Patriots a 24-14 lead. Following a 49ers punt, an 8-play Patriots drive resulted in a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 27-14 early in the fourth quarter. Starting from their own 20-yard line, the 49ers began an 11-play drive that ended on a 5-yard touchdown catch by Bruce from O'Sullivan that cut the Patriots' lead to 27-21. The Patriots responded with a 10-play series of their own; six plays into the drive, Faulk caught a second-down pass and was originally deemed to be down short of the first down, but the Patriots challenged the play and Faulk was found to have gained the necessary first down yardage. An offensive pass interference penalty on Moss set up a 3rd and 20 that the Patriots did not convert; Gostkowski then hit a 49-yard line field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 30-21. A third-down sack of O'Sullivan led to a fourth-down interception by O'Neal that gave the Patriots the ball with 2:45 remaining in the game. The 49ers used all of their timeouts during the Patriots' next possession, and after a Patriots punt, the 49ers failed to convert on fourth down to give the Patriots the ball to end the game.", "qas":

Cowboys went to the Superdome to take on the undefeated New Orleans Saints. The Cowboys took the lead in the first half by scoring two touchdowns with a 49-yard pass from Tony Romo to Miles Austin and a 3-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber. Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware made a big play as he sacked Saints quarterback Drew Brees and caused the ball to be fumbled. Anthony Spencer recovered the ball to put it in Dallas' hands. The Saints only points of the half were from a 43-yard field goal by Garrett Hartley. In the second half, the Cowboys scored their only touchdown in the third quarter with a two-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber. Finally in the fourth quarter New Orleans got a touchdown when running back Mike Bell scored from one yard out to make a 24-10 Dallas lead. Drew Brees also made a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Moore. After that, Nick Folk attempted a 24-yard field goal, but the kick was no good. With a big advantage to take the lead as the clock was expiring, the Saints were driving for the game-tying score, but DeMarcus Ware made his second sack on Drew Brees, which again caused the ball to be fumbled. This time the ball was recovered by nose guard Jay Ratliff. With the ball in possession, Dallas took a knee to conclude the game. With a huge win over the once-undefeated Saints, the Cowboys extended their chances to make the playoffs and ended a two-game losing streak. They improved their record to 9-5.", "qas": [{"id": "a4dfc927-3e1e-4602-a3ac-ad89f215294a", "question": "Who had the longer touchdown play, Barber or Austin?", "answer_type": "spans",

The following Sunday, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks at home went on to win 88\u201376, assuring them a 7\u20131 record. After two tough losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home in a game against the Detroit Pistons on November 25, with a 121\u2013100 blowout win, making them one of only three teams undefeated at home along with the Miami Heat and Utah Jazz. The Knicks finished November with an 11\u20134 record, their best month record since going 11\u20136 in March 2000. By the All-Star break in mid-February 2013, the Knicks compiled a 32\u201318 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference. On February 21, on the trade deadline, the team traded Ronnie Brewer for a 2014 second-round draft pick. The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993\u201394 NBA season.

The team set an NBA record with 54 consecutive regular-season home wins, which spanned from January 31, 2015 to March 29, 2016; the previous record of 44 was held by the 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls

as a Cowboy (FOX promoted it as being the game of the year), the Eagles went up against their long-time rival at home, as another chapter was written in the famed Dallas Cowboys-Philadelphia Eagles rivalry.  In the first quarter, the Eagles drew first blood as running back Brian Westbrook got a 5-yard TD run (which was set up on a fumbled punt attempt), while kicker David Akers kicked a 27-yard field goal after a quarterback Drew Bledsoe fumble.  The Cowboys would score in the period, as running back Marion Barber got a 2-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Cowboys OLB Greg Ellis sacked QB Donovan McNabb, causing him to fumble, which was picked up by OLB DeMarcus Ware who returned it 69 yards for a touchdown. McNabb would make up for his fumble by getting a 1-yard touchdown on a QB sneak after a long completion to L.J. Smith.  However, the Eagles trailed at halftime, as Bledsoe ran 7 yards for a score. In the third quarter, Philadelphia would get back on top, as McNabb threw an 87-yard bomb to rookie wide receiver Hank Baskett.  In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys evened the score with a Mike Vanderjagt 39-yard field goal.  The Eagles responded with a 40-yard McNabb to Reggie Brown flea-flicker touchdown. With Dallas threatening to tie the score late in the game, cornerback Lito Sheppard, who already had an interception, returned a Bledsoe pass 102 yards for a touchdown. With their 38-24 victory, Philadelphia managed to take the lead in the NFC East. McNabb finished with 354 yards, two passing TDs and one rushing TD, while Owens was a nonfactor with only 3 catches for 45 yards and several drops.

The Packers and Lions eventually lost to the Steelers and Giants, respectively, putting the Bears in position to win the division by defeating the Eagles. The last game between the Bears and Eagles was in 2011, when the Bears won 30-24; the Bears also lead the all-time series 30-12-1, though the Eagles had won six of the last ten meetings. However, the Bears had won four of five meetings between the two teams in the last six years, but all by less than six points. One of the Bears' keys to victory is to prevent LeSean McCoy from dominating; the Bears had the worst run defense in the league, while McCoy leads the league in rushing. Chicago's defense also must contain the Eagles' fast-scoring offense: the Eagles had the lowest average time of possession per drive at 2:24, while the league average is 3:27. Philadelphia also is the only team in the league to score in fewer than seven plays per drive. In the passing game, Chicago had the fourth-best passing offense, while the Eagles were 26th in pass defense. However, the Eagles are ranked sixth in rushing defense. The Bears fell behind early in the first quarter when Nick Foles threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper with 9:54 to go, followed by Devin Hester getting the ball stripped on the ensuing kickoff and Cary Williams recovering the loose ball. LeSean McCoy eventually scored on a 1-yard run with 7:44 in the first, and Philadelphia added to the scoring with Foles throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to Brent Celek. After Alex Henery kicked a 49-yard field goal, the Bears scored their first points of the game with Robbie Gould's 50-yard field goal on the last play of the first half. In the second half, the Eagles scored off a safety after Cedric Thornton tackled Matt Fort&#233;. Philadelphia scored again after McCoy recorded another rushing touchdown. The Bears scored their first touchdown after Jay Cutler threw a 6-yard pass to Brandon Marshall, followed by a two-point conversion off Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett. With 11:19 remaining, Chris Polk scored on a 10-yard run to increase the score to 40-11, added by Brandon Boykin intercepting Cutler and scoring on a 54-yard return. Afterwards, Josh McCown filled in for Cutler. The Eagles scored again after Bryce Brown ran 65 yards for the touchdown to make the final score 54-11, the biggest blowout since a 47-0 loss to the Houston Oilers in 1977 and the second-most points allowed in team history, behind a 55-20 loss to Detroit in 1997. The Bears failed to score 18 points for the first time in 2013, while allowing a season-high five sacks. Chicago also allowed two 100-yard rushers in the same game for the first time since 1976 against the Denver Broncos, with Norris Weese (120 yards) and Ottis Anderson (116 yards) guiding the Broncos to 28-14 win.

In 2011, Bloom Energy, a major fuel cell supplier, said that its fuel cells generated power at 9-11 cents per kilowatt-hour, including the price of fuel, maintenance, and hardware.", "qas": [{"id": "d1ab4ade-9c8f-44e2-99b2-e2e42171a1e4", "question": "How many more fuel cell stacks were shipped in 2010 than 2007?", "answer_type": "number", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["2012", "1", "2014", "140000", "2010", "11000", "2007", "2011", "2012", "85", "2011", "50", "2010", "2009", "4", "2011", "724", "775", "2011", "9", "11", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "be1d6858-3a53-4394-98ea-8aa5929b9280", "question": "How many fuel cell stacks were shipped in 2007?", "answer_type": "number", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["2012", "1", "2014", "140000", "2010", "11000", "2007", "2011", "2012", "85", "2011", "50", "2010", "2009", "4", "2011", "724", "775", "2011", "9", "11", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "4c21ac40-bfad-4f39-8d1f-cc2da4b32c17", "question": "How many dollars difference is there between the minimum and maximum number of dollars per kilowatts installed in January 2011?", "answer_type": "number", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["2012", "1", "2014", "140000", "2010", "11000", "2007", "2011", "2012", "85", "2011", "50", "2010", "2009", "4", "2011", "724", "775", "2011", "9", "11", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "3b986693-21d4-490b-9c2d-cac5dcd6d8f3", "question": "How many cents difference is there between the minimum and maximum cents per kilowatt-hour generated by Bloom Energy fuel cells?", "answer_type": "number", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["2012", "1", "2014", "140000", "2010", "11000", "2007", "2011", "2012", "85", "2011", "50", "2010", "2009", "4", "2011", "724", "775", "2011", "9", "11", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [2]}]}]}, {"title": "history_3908", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2003, \"Appalachian\" Tennessee&mdash; which included all of East Tennessee and the easternmost counties in Middle Tennessee&mdash; had a three-year average unemployment rate of 4.9%, compared with 5.6% statewide and 5.5% nationwide.

This would be the first time that Buffalo ever hosted Tampa Bay in a regular season game, having played a preseason game with each other in 1977. In the first quarter, the Bills came out firing as quarterback Trent Edwards completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans, safety Donte Whitner returning an interception 76 yards for a touchdown and kicker Rian Lindell making a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers would get on the board in the second quarter as quarterback Byron Leftwich completed a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kellen Winslow, while Buffalo replied with Lindell getting a 43-yard field goal. Tampa Bay would close out the half as Leftwich completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams. After a scoreless third quarter, the Bills began to pull away as Lindell got a 43-yard field goal and Edwards completed a 43-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. The Buccaneers tried to rally as Leftwich completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jerramy Stevens (with a failed two-point conversion), yet Buffalo closed out the game with Lindell nailing a 20-yard field goal.

Packers started hot and never looked back, cruising to an easy win over the Eagles, who were tied for the best record in the NFL. The Packers took the ball and went 75 yards, with the big play being Aaron Rodgers hooking up with Jordy Nelson for 65 yards. However, two incomplete passes forced the Packers to settle for a 27-yard Mason Crosby field goal. After an Eagles punt, the Packers stormed 88 yards in 13 plays, taking 6:47 off the clock, ending with Rodgers connecting with DaVante Adams for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Rodgers continued to show that the Eagles' secondary was no match. The Eagles went three-and-out on their next drive, but this time Micah Hyde returned the punt 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the Packers lead to 17-0 in the first quarter. The Eagles finally managed points on their next drive, going 44 yards in 10 plays before Cody Parkey hit a 33-yard field goal with 13:08 remaining in the half. Unfortunately, for the Eagles, there was no stopping Aaron Rodgers. The Packers advanced 80 yards in only 6 plays, with Rodgers throwing for 60 yard on the drive, including the 27-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. The Eagles offense continued to sputter, punting on their next possession. The Packers continued their utter domination, moving to the Eagles 19 yard-line, but Malcolm Jenkins was flagged for pass interference in the end zone, moving the ball to the 1 yard-line. Eddie Lacy took it in on the very next play(the Packers two-point conversion attempt was unsuccessful) and the Packers led 30-3 with just 2:00 minutes left in the half. On their next drive, the Eagles managed to move 65 yards and Cody Parkey hit his second field goal of the half, trimming the score to 30-6 at halftime. The Eagles drove into Packer territory on their first possession of the second half, but Mark Sanchez lost a fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry. The Packers punted for the first time all night on their next drive, but the Eagles did nothing, punting themselves. The Packers proceeded to march 48 yards and Crosby was successful from 33 yards away, giving the Packers a 33-6 lead. On the following drive Mark Sanchez continued to give up the ball, with defensive end Julius Peppers returning an interception 52 yards for a touchdown making the score 39-6(Crosby's PAT was blocked). Sanchez drove the Eagles 80 yards, hitting Jordan Matthews 10 yards for a touchdown, closing the gap to 39-13. Rodgers responded by hitting Lacy 32 yards for a touchdown on a screen pass. Sanchez threw his second interception of the night on the next possession, but Crosby missed a field goal. Once again Sanchez turned it over (this time on a fumble), and Casey Hayward returned it 49 yards for a touchdown, making the score a humiliating, 53-13. Sanchez hit Jeremy Maclin for a 20-yard touchdown pass on the next Eagle possession, to close the scoring, giving the Packers a 53-20 victory. The Packers out gained the Eagles 475-429, but four turnovers (all by Sanchez) buried the Eagles.", "qas": [{"id": "b07c4817-553d-44d3-a107-f0a61509707a", "question": "Which team was losing by 27

In 1625, when the Republic of Genoa, traditionally an ally of Spain, was occupied by French troops of the Duke of Savoy, the city underwent a hard siege. It was known in Genoese governmental circles that one of the reasons why the Dutch government had offered their help to the Franco-Savoyan army was so that they could \"hit the bank of the King of Spain\". However, the Spanish fleet commanded by General \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, Marquis of Santa Cruz, came to the aid of Genoa and relieved the city. Returning its sovereignty to the Republic of Genoa and forcing the French to raise the siege, they consequently began a combined campaign against the Franco-Savoyan forces that had overrun the Genoese Republic one year before. The joint Franco-Piedmontese army was forced to leave Liguria and Spanish troops invaded Piedmont, thereby securing the Spanish Road.

The overthrow of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan by the Red Army in April 1920 created a precedent for the Bolsheviks in Georgia. Georgia had been in a defense alliance with Azerbaijan since 1919, but the Menshevik government hesitated to get involved in the conflict. In his April 30 speech, Georgian Premier Noe Zhordania stated that his country had been prepared to come to aid to Azerbaijan provided that the latter's own people fought for their independence. But as the Reds met minimal resistance in Baku, the Georgian government chose not to, a decision that was heavily criticized by the opposition.

the viceroy into the city in late 1521, a moderate repression started.  Viceroy Diego Hurtado de Mendoza did not wish to start a new revolt, but took action against the most important of the leaders, and issued a general pardon to minor agermanats who had merely served in the army. However, Mendoza was replaced as viceroy by Germaine of Foix, Ferdinand's second wife, who returned to the country with Charles and a new German husband .  She favored a harsher policy toward the rebels, and approximately 800 death sentences to former rebels would be dispensed.  Sources differ on how much she personally ordered, but it seems likely at least 100 death warrants were directly approved of by her.  Heavy fines were imposed on the guilds as punishment, as well as a total of more than 360,000 ducats of fines to all cities that had sided with the Germanies, and 2,000,000 ducats of fines were levied in compensations for damages sustained by properties during the war. The period of heavier repression ended on December 23, 1524, when Germaine signed a pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia and by extension the other Germanies.  King Charles signed an additional general pardon in 1528, suggesting that scattered reprisals might have continued afterward.  Germaine was in favor of the integration of Spain, and Catalan nationalists point to her pardon as one of the first official documents in Aragon written in Castilian Spanish.", "qas": [{"id":

"history_2512", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2013\u201314 West Ham United F.C. season, West Ham finished 13th in the Premier League. They also reached the semi-finals of the Football League Cup before losing 9\u20130 on aggregate to eventual cup-winners Manchester City F.C.. A feature of the season were the criticisms of manager Sam Allardyce by supporters relating to his perceived negative playing tactics. West Ham finished 12th in the 2014\u201315 Premier League, one place higher than the previous season. Minutes after the last game of the season, on 24 May 2015, the club announced that Allardyces contract would not be renewed and that they were seeking a new manager. By winning the Premier League Fair Play league for 2014\u201315, West Ham qualified for the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League, entering at the first qualifying round. On 9 June 2015, former West Ham player Slaven Bili\u0107 was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. In Bili\u0107s fourth game in charge, the team won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years, beating Liverpool 0\u20133, with goals from Manuel Lanzini, Mark Noble and Diafra Sakho. In Bili\u0107s first season as manager, West Ham finished seventh in the Premier League. The team broke several records for the club in the Premier League era, including the highest number of points (62), the highest number of goals in a season (65), the least number of games lost in a season (8) and the lowest number of away defeats (5). Following Manchester Uniteds win in the 2016 FA Cup Final, West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League. In August 2016, Andr\u00e9 Ayew became the clubs most expensive signing after joining for a fee of \u00a320.5 million from Swansea City A.F.C..

The youngest son of Prince Paata Abashidze, he was served as a priest until about 1684 when he entered politics after the death of his elder brother Paata Abashidze and began aggressively expanding his patrimonial fiefdom. He dispossessed the Chkheidze family of Shorapani, and the Agiashvili of Tsutskhvati, and took control of the royal domain in Upper Imereti. His daughter, Tamar, was married to the two successive kings of Imereti, Alexander IV and George V. During the reign of the latter monarch, Abashidze effectively ran the government and acted as an all-powerful kingmaker. In 1699, he gave his daughter Anika in marriage to King Simon of Imereti, but they divorced in 1700. In 1701, Abashidze compelled King Mamia of Imereti to abdicate and seized the throne for himself. He managed to establish a degree of stability in Imereti and ceased to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire, triggering a military response in 1703. He also patronized culture and learning. Deposed after a revolt by the nobles, in favour of the rightful Bagrationi king George VII, Abashidze took refuge at the court of Vakhtang VI of Kartli in Tbilisi.

For example, in April 1921, the IRA in Belfast shot dead two Auxiliaries in Donegal Place in Belfast city centre. The same night, two Catholics were killed on the Falls Road. On 10 July 1921 the IRA ambushed British forces in Raglan street in Belfast. In the following week, sixteen Catholics were killed and 216 Catholic homes burned in reprisal - events known as Belfast's Bloody Sunday. Killings on the loyalist side were largely carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force , allegedly with the aid of the RIC and especially the auxiliary police force, the Ulster Special Constabulary or \"B-Specials\". The Special Constabulary , was largely recruited from Ulster Volunteer Force and Orange Lodges and, in the words of historian Michael Hopkinson, \"amounted to an officially approved UVF\". In May James Craig came to Dublin to meet the British Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord FitzAlan, and was smuggled by the IRA through Dublin to meet \u00c9amon de Valera.

Seven minutes into the third quarter, Reggie Bush sped past the Giants' linebacker corps and scored on a one-yard touchdown, to lengthen the score to 20-7. In the middle of the third quarter, Reggie Bush returned a punt, fell onto his knees (but because nobody touched him he was not down by contact), and he then ran the ball in for a touchdown. However, a challenge revealed that the Giants' punter just barely nicked the leg of Bush, and he was ruled down by contact.  Early in the fourth quarter, Deuce McAllister ran it in for the final touchdown of the day, and John Carney sealed it with a 38-yard field goal.

dominating win over the previously unbeaten Packers, the Broncos traveled to Lucas Oil Stadium to face the Indianapolis Colts. A 7-yard touchdown run by running back Frank Gore in the first quarter, followed in the second quarter by a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Adam Vinatieri and a 3-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andrew Luck to tight end Jack Doyle gave the Colts a 17-0 lead. The latter scoring play occurred after Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Colts' safety Mike Adams. The Broncos got on the scoreboard in the closing seconds of the first half, with return specialist Omar Bolden returning a punt 83 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos narrowed the gap on their initial possession of the second half, with Manning throwing a 64-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, then tied the game, with a 29-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Colts re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Luck to running back Ahmad Bradshaw. The Broncos responded, with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Manning to tight end Owen Daniels, in what would the final regular-season touchdown pass of Manning's career. Another field goal by Vinatieri &#8212; from 55 yards out, gave the Colts a 27-24 lead with 6:18 remaining in the game. On the Broncos' first play of their next possession, Manning was intercepted by Colts' cornerback Darius Butler. The Colts' offense forced the Broncos to use all of their timeouts, and with 28 seconds remaining, Vinatieri kicked a 23-yard field goal. However, the Colts decided not to take the points due to a defensive holding penalty on Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan, which enabled Luck to end the game on a quarterback kneel.", "qas": [{"id": "f2a54250-88e8-4c18-93a7-a3b2a518d5b0", "question": "How many interceptions did Manning have?", "answer_type": "number", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["7", "43", "3", "17", "0", "83", "64", "29", "8", "1", "8212", "55", "27", "24", "28", "23", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [2]}, {"id": "d9d48361-e5f1-400e-8368-0cea5bad2b7b", "question": "How long was the longest field goal of the game?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 252, "text": "43-yard", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["7", "43", "3", "17", "0", "83", "64", "29", "8", "1", "8212", "55", "27", "24", "28", "23", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "a1c48a9e-197a-4228-a1b3-ec0f79009bec", "question": "Which running back got the first rushing touchdown?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 183, "text": "Frank Gore", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["7", "43", "3", "17", "0", "83", "64", "29", "8", "1", "8212", "55", "27", "24", "28", "23", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "51d5debe-f87a-4dca-bad3-3adf2916bc8d", "question": "Which kickers ended up making the first field goal?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 286, "text": "Adam Vinatieri", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["7", "43", "3", "17", "0", "83", "64", "29", "8", "1", "8212", "55", "27", "24", "28", "23", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "b995a418-b48b-421b-b557-7b180bd4170c", "question": "Which player had the first touchdown pass of the game?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 346, "text": "Andrew Luck", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["7", "43", "3", "17", "0", "83", "64", "29", "8", "1", "8212", "55", "27", "24", "28", "23", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "a8922ef1-9025-439e-bebc-7a32a2f4b9c6", "question": "Which team would go on to win the game?", "answer_type": "spans", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": 387, "text": "the Colts", "is_impossible": false}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["7", "43", "3", "17", "0", "83", "64", "29", "8", "1", "8212", "55", "27", "24", "28", "23", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [-1]}, {"id": "33f814cb-8826-4574-9de8-bc9ed34809a8", "question": "How many yards difference was Adam Vinatieri\u2019s last field goal compared to Emmanuel Sanders's field goal?", "answer_type": "number", "answers_as_question_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answers_as_passage_spans": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "", "is_impossible": true}], "answer_as_add_sub_expressions": [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]], "answer_as_add_sub_numbers": ["7", "43", "3", "17", "0", "83", "64", "29", "8", "1", "8212", "55", "27", "24", "28", "23", "0"], "answer_as_counts": [6]}]}]}, {"title": "nfl_384", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Trying to end a five-game skid, the Rams went home for an NFC West rematch with their historic rival, the San Francisco 49ers.

visit of Pope Francis generated excitement in the city of Philadelphia, the Eagles made the first of two visits to MetLife Stadium to square off with the Jets. The Eagles improved their all-time head-to-head record against the Jets to 10-0. DeMarco Murray was out with a hamstring injury, but Ryan Mathews carried the load, rushing 25 times for 108 yards. Darren Sproles also ran for 17 yards and one touchdown, but the highlight of his game was an 89-yard punt return for a touchdown. In the first half, all areas of the Eagles dominated the Jets 24-7. Right before the first half ended, Brandon Marshall fumbled the ball on an ill-conceived lateral attempt, which was recovered the Eagles and turned into a Darren Sproles 1-yard touchdown run. In the second half, the Eagles attempted to mostly maintain the lead and run the clock out, using a majority of run plays that the Jets were able to predict. Eric Rowe, Jordan Hicks, and Walter Thurmond all intercepted Ryan Fitzpatrick in the game, who had done relatively well with turnovers until this game. The Jets would however score 10 unanswered points, but the Eagles would stop their comeback by recovering an onside kick and being able to get a first down off a last-minute Jets penalty. The Eagles improved to 1-2 and were tied at 2nd place in the NFC East along with the Redskins and the Giants. A day later, the Eagles announced that kicker Cody Parkey would undergo season-ending groin surgery.", "qas": [{"id": "07592d7f-06e8-4e07-9a7d-4c72c87d678e", "question": "How many points did the Jets
